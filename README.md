This project aims to develop a data-driven BI system leveraging freely available data and incorporating heterogeneous sources for cross-analysis. This project encompasses various stages, including analysis, transformation, and aggregation, with careful consideration given to:

1. Environment Selection: This involves choosing suitable tools for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), database management, and BI platform to ensure seamless integration and effective data processing.

2. Presentation and Analysis Methodology: The project focuses on presenting insights through interactive data visualization in Power BI, facilitating in-depth analysis and decision-making.

3. Report Structure: The structure of reports is designed to provide clear and actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to derive valuable insights from the data.

4. Optimization: Emphasis is placed on optimizing processes to enhance efficiency and performance throughout the BI system.

Dataset: The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle DataSet, providing a diverse range of data for analysis and integration.

Built With:
- Power BI: Utilized for interactive data visualization, offering dynamic insights and exploration capabilities.
- Python: Employed for data integration, serving as a modern ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool to handle diverse data formats effectively.
